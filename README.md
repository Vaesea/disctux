# DiscTux (Contains spoilers for current and future versions)

SuperTux is a jump'n'run game with strong inspiration from the
Super Mario Bros. games for the various Nintendo platforms.

Now let's focus on the fact that this is a mod of SuperTux named
DiscTux. This mod aims to basically have the SuperTux worlds turned
into 2 level-act 1 boss-act zones, along with some new zones, some
based on SuperTux's worlds (Crystalline Cavern = Crystal Mines, 
which I know is still Icy Islands but whatever) and it has time
travel, with Sonic CD's timelines such as Past, Present, Good Future
and Bad Future, which all means it's SuperTux but Sonic CD.

I'm aware there's probably something out there that's like SuperTux + Sonic CD, but I don't really care.

Crystalline Cavern Round (Crystal Mine) (CC) (R2)
