# DiscTux (Contains spoilers for current and future versions)

SuperTux is a jump'n'run game with strong inspiration from the
Super Mario Bros. games for the various Nintendo platforms.

Now let's focus on the fact that this is a mod of SuperTux named
DiscTux. This mod aims to basically have the SuperTux worlds turned
into 2 level-act 1 boss-act zones, along with some new zones, some
based on SuperTux's worlds (Crystalline Cavern = Crystal Mines, 
which I know is still Icy Islands but whatever) and it has time
travel, with Sonic CD's timelines such as Past, Present, Good Future
and Bad Future, which all means it's SuperTux but Sonic CD.

I'm aware there's probably something out there that's like SuperTux + Sonic CD, but I don't really care.

## Worlds / Zones

Icy Island Round (Icy Island) (II) (R1)

Crystalline Cavern Round (Crystal Mine) (CC) (R2)

Radical Ruins Round (RR) (R3) (Secret)

Secret Stronghold Zone (SS) (Only 1 zone so that's why it's called a zone instead of a round) (R3.5) (Secret)

Forest Fantasy Round (Rooted Forest) (FF) (R4)

Volcanic Vacation Round (VV) (R5)

### Planned for Demo 3

Calm Coast (Tropical Paradise beach) (BB) (R6)

Forest Fantasy Round 2 (Bad Future) (Corrupted Forest) (FF2) (R4 again)

Volcanic Vacation Round 2 (Bad Future) (VV2) (R5 again)

### Planned for the full thing

Radical Ruins Round 2 (Past) (RR2) (R3 again) (The hole in the sky created by the red crystal set Radical Ruins back in time as the rainbow stuff around it blocked the red crystal trying to make it a bad future, although since it's the past now, the rainbow stuff is weaker)

Pinnacle Peak Round (Mountain Peaks) (i know it's a terrible name) (PP) (R7)

Metallic Monstrosity Round (Nolok's Castle) (MM) (R8) (the name is inspired by mettalic madness) (Tux wouldn't be able to defeat Nolok here and he'd be there sleeping for almost three months)

Artificial Asteroid Round (Radical Ruins Terrible Future) (RR3) (AA) (R3 again again) (Nolok used the power of the red crystal to remove the rainbow stuff from Radical Ruins first before putting it into a bad future after, and after that, he quickly took over Radical Ruins, turning it into an island just floating in space using the red crystal, about to destroy earth just because it'd be funny)

### Planned to be added on later after the full thing

*Extra World - "The Bonus Rounds":*

Woodland Winter Round (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CXOJVytKXI0 but winter) (WW) 

Vertical Venture Round (Mountain Peaks + 3DS Celeste) (VV)

Radical Ruins Round 4 (Good Future) (RR4) (R3 again again again)

The Bonus Rounds does happen in the DiscTux story but it's years after the main story.
