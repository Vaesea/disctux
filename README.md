# DiscTux (Contains spoilers for current and future versions)

SuperTux is a jump'n'run game with strong inspiration from the
Super Mario Bros. games for the various Nintendo platforms.

Now let's focus on the fact that this is a mod of SuperTux named
DiscTux. This mod aims to basically have the SuperTux worlds turned
into 2 level-act 1 boss-act zones, along with some new zones, some
based on SuperTux's worlds (Crystalline Cavern = Crystal Mines, 
which I know is still Icy Islands but whatever) and it has time
travel, with Sonic CD's timelines such as Past, Present, Good Future
and Bad Future, which all means it's SuperTux but Sonic CD.

I'm aware there's probably something out there that's like SuperTux + Sonic CD, but I don't really care.

## Worlds / Zones

Icy Island Round (Icy Island) (II) (R1)

Crystalline Cavern Round (Crystal Mine) (CC) (R2)

Radical Ruins Round (RR) (R3) (Secret)

Secret Stronghold Zone (SS) (Only 1 zone so that's why it's called a zone instead of a round) (R3.5) (Secret)

Forest Fantasy Round (Rooted Forest) (FF) (R4)

Volcanic Vacation Round (VV) (R5)

### Planned for Demo 3

Calm Coast (Tropical Paradise beach) (BB) (R6)

Forest Fantasy Round 2 (Bad Future) (Corrupted Forest) (FF2) (R4 again)

Volcanic Vacation Round 2 (Bad Future) (VV2) (R5 again)

### Planned for the full thing

Radical Ruins Round 2 (Past) (RR2) (R3 again) (The hole in the sky created by the red crystal set Radical Ruins back in time as the rainbow stuff around it blocked the red crystal trying to make it a bad future)

Manic Mountain Round (Mountain Peaks) (i know it's a terrible name) (MM) (R7)

Baleful Building (Nolok's Castle) (uses the old castle background tileset thingy) (BB) (R8)

### Planned to be added on later after the full thing

*Extra World - "The Bonus Rounds":*

The Bonus Rounds does happen in the DiscTux story but it's years after the main story.
